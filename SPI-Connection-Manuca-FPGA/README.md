# SPI connection between Manuca Microcontroller and FPGA

The [Hex Conversion Folder](pythonScript-hexConversion) contains the script necessary for the endian conversion.

There are additionally two files that I've used for the Pin Mapping. The [PDF](MA_Evaluation_Board.pdf) contains the layout of the Manuca Microcontroller (Air and Evaluation board) Boards. The [Excel file](PinMapping.xlsx) contains the condensed pin mapping for the SPI Connection.

Documentation of what had been done:
