# Visual Wake Word Application

## C Implementation

contains implemetation of Visual Wake Word Application in C include all parameters needed in header files


## Node Representation

contains Layer-Node Representation of Visual Wake Word Network

## Trained Model 298000Iter

Trained Visual Wakeword Application trained for 298,000 iterations with input size 96x96

## Trained Model 1000000Iter

Trained Visual Wakeword Application trained for 1,000,000 iterations with input size 96x96

##TVM Scripts

Contains all scripts used for extracting model parameters from trained TFLite models with the help of TVM. To run these scripts it is necessary to install TVM, more information in the ReadMe File within that folder.

##other Files

The Person Detection Algorithm Excel File contains detailed information about the layer structure of the implemented model.

The TrainPersonDetect Jupyter Notebook contains the script to train the model for the Person Detection Algorithm. I used it in Google Colab. Maybe there need to be done some modifications if you run it as a jupyter notebook.
